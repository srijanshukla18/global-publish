### **1. Product Hunt: The 24-Hour Gauntlet**

Product Hunt is not a discovery platform; it's a 24-hour launch competition. Your goal isn't just to be on it, but to finish in the **Top 5** for the day to get the coveted newsletter feature and lasting visibility.

* **The Hunter is Overrated (Sort of):** In the past, a top "Hunter" (someone who posts the product) was critical. Now, it's less important. The algorithm prioritizes organic engagement. It's better to hunt the product yourself or have a teammate do it. This gives you full control over the assets and timing.
* **The 12:01 AM PST Rule:** This is non-negotiable. Launches run on a 24-hour cycle starting at midnight Pacific Time. Launching at 12:01 AM gives you the maximum possible time to gather upvotes and climb the leaderboard.
* **The Maker's First Comment:** This is a critical, expected tradition. As soon as your product is live, the first comment *must* be from you (the "Maker"). It should be your origin story, include an exclusive deal for the PH community (e.g., "25% off with code PH25"), and end with a question to encourage engagement.
* **The Animated GIF Thumbnail:** A static logo is a death sentence. Your thumbnail *must* be an animated GIF that quickly demonstrates what your product does. It's the single most important visual asset for stopping the scroll.
* **Don't Ask for Upvotes, Ask for "Feedback":** Directly asking for upvotes is a cardinal sin. The correct way to phrase your outreach is: *"We're live on Product Hunt today! Would love to get your feedback and support on our launch."*
* **Engage with Every Single Comment:** Your job on launch day is to be the most responsive person on the internet. Reply to every comment within minutes if possible. The algorithm rewards active, engaged discussions.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | Gamified competition, novelty, and the "new" factor. |
| **Ideal Title Format** | `[Product Name] - [Clear, concise tagline describing what it does].` |
| **Suggested Post Type** | The official "Product" post hunted via the platform. |
| **Ideal Timing** | 12:01 AM PST (non-negotiable). |
| **Critical Launch Prep** | Animated GIF thumbnail; maker's "origin story" comment ready; an exclusive offer for the PH community prepared. |
| **CTA Style** | Ask for feedback and support. The real CTA is the exclusive discount in the first comment. |
| **Emotional Tone** | Excited, humble, and extremely responsive. |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24 hours. The goal is the daily Top 5 newsletter feature, which provides lasting value. |

### **2. Reddit: The Art of Infiltration**

Reddit despises self-promotion. You cannot just show up and drop a link. A successful launch is the final step of a longer process of becoming a genuine community member.

* **Subreddit Reconnaissance:** Every subreddit is a different country with its own laws and culture. Your strategy for `r/javascript` will fail in `r/sideproject`. Spend at least two weeks before your launch being active in your target subreddit.
* **The "Value-First" Post:** Never lead with your product. Lead with value. Write a tutorial or share a story about a problem you solved. Mention your tool at the very end as a "P.S." or when someone asks in the comments.
* **The Karma Threshold:** Many subreddits have minimum karma and account age requirements to post. A brand new account will be automatically blocked. You *must* use an established account with a positive history.
* **The "Soft Ask" in Comments:** Often, the best strategy is to not even link your product in the main post. Write a post about a problem. When someone comments, "Is there a tool that does X?", that is your golden opportunity to reply with your link. This is seen as helpful, not spammy.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | Providing value to a specific community; authenticity over polish. |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Varies by subreddit. "How I solved [problem]" or "I built a tool to..." works well. Avoid brand names. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A "Value-First" post (tutorial, story) with a soft mention, OR a "Show and Tell" post in a relevant sub like `r/sideproject`. |
| **Ideal Timing** | Subreddit-specific. Typically weekday mornings in the dominant timezone of the sub (e.g., US morning for `r/programming`). |
| **Critical Launch Prep** | High-karma, established account; 2+ weeks of genuine participation in the target sub; read the sidebar rules meticulously. |
| **CTA Style** | Very soft. "Link in comments if anyone's interested," or replying to a direct question. |
| **Emotional Tone** | Helpful community member, not a marketer. Humble and open to criticism. |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-48 hours on the subreddit's "hot" page. |

### **3. LinkedIn: The Professional's "Build in Public" Stage**

LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors personal stories from founders over corporate brand pages. The key is to maximize "dwell time."

* **The "Dwell Time" Algorithm:** LinkedIn wants to keep users on your post. A simple link pointing away from LinkedIn is the worst thing you can do.
* **The Carousel (PDF) Post:** This is the ultimate format. Create a 5-10 slide PDF presentation telling a story. People have to click through, which massively boosts dwell time.
* **"Link in the First Comment":** This is a critical, platform-specific tactic. In your post, write "Link in the comments!". Then, post the link as the very first comment. This prevents the algorithm from penalizing your post for an external link.
* **The "Broetry" Format:** Write your posts in short, one-sentence paragraphs. This is optimized for mobile reading and slows people down, increasing dwell time.
* **The First 90 Minutes Matter Most:** The algorithm decides a post's fate in the first hour and a half. Rally your team and supporters to comment and react as soon as you post. Reply to every single comment immediately.
* **Tell a Personal Story:** Frame the launch around your personal journey. "I almost gave up 3 times while building this..." performs infinitely better than "Our company is excited to announce..."

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | Professional identity; personal career journey. |
| **Ideal Title Format** | The first line of the post is the hook. Make it a personal, attention-grabbing statement about your journey. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | Carousel (PDF) post detailing a story. **Avoid direct external links in the post body.** |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekday mornings (Tue–Thu, 8–10 AM in your target audience's timezone). |
| **Critical Launch Prep** | Carousel PDF designed; personal story written out; team/supporters ready to engage in the first 90 mins. |
| **CTA Style** | "Link in the first comment." Encourage discussion in the post itself. |
| **Emotional Tone** | Professional but vulnerable. Share the struggle and the success of the journey. |
| **Post Lifespan** | 48-72 hours of peak visibility, but lives permanently on your profile. |

### **4. Indie Hackers: The Transparency Report**

Indie Hackers is for founders, by founders. They don't care about polished marketing; they care about raw numbers, authenticity, and the messy reality of building a business.

* **Revenue is the Ultimate Social Proof:** The single most respected feature on IH is the public revenue tracker on your product page. Be transparent. Even if it's $50 MRR, it's infinitely more respected than $0.
* **Launch as a "Milestone," Not a "Product":** The community is more receptive to journey updates than to launch announcements. Frame your post as a milestone, e.g., "We just hit 100 users and are officially launching out of beta!"
* **The "Ask IH" Post:** A great way to soft-launch is to ask for feedback on a specific part of your business, e.g., "Ask IH: How would you price this? [link to product]". It gets eyes on your product in a way that is framed as a request for help, which the community loves to provide.
* **Engage with the Big Names:** The founder, Courtland Allen, and other prominent IH members are very active. A comment or upvote from them on your launch post can be a huge signal boost.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | Transparency (revenue, metrics); honest founder journey. |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Milestone-based. "How we got to $X MRR," "Just launched V2 after 100 user interviews," etc. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A "Milestone" post or an "Ask IH" post seeking specific advice (pricing, marketing). |
| **Ideal Timing** | Less time-sensitive, but US weekday mornings are generally best for visibility. |
| **Critical Launch Prep** | Updated product page with (ideally) public revenue; a well-written, honest story about the struggles and learnings. |
| **CTA Style** | Ask for feedback, thoughts on the journey, or advice on a specific problem. |
| **Emotional Tone** | Open, honest, transparent, and collaborative. |
| **Post Lifespan** | A few days on the front page; becomes a permanent part of your product's public history on the site. |

### **5. Twitter/X: The Narrative Thread**

On Twitter/X, a launch isn't a single moment; it's the climax of a public narrative. Success comes from building an audience that is already invested in your journey and wants to see you win.

* **The Launch Thread is Mandatory:** A single tweet will get lost. You must use a multi-tweet thread to tell a story. The classic, effective structure is:
    1.  **The Hook:** The first tweet. Make it a bold claim, a relatable problem, or a surprising stat. This is 80% of the battle.
    2.  **The Problem:** Agitate the pain point your product solves.
    3.  **The Solution:** Introduce your product as the solution.
    4.  **Key Features:** Use 2-3 tweets to show off the best features, each with a high-quality screenshot or, even better, a short screen recording (GIF).
    5.  **Social Proof:** A tweet with a testimonial or a compliment you've received.
    6.  **The Ask/CTA:** The final tweet with the clear call to action and the link.
* **"Build in Public" is Your Pre-Launch:** The real work happens in the months before you launch. Tweet about your progress, share mockups and ask for feedback, talk about the challenges. This builds an audience that feels like they are part of the story.
* **Visuals are Non-Negotiable:** Every tweet in your launch thread (except maybe the first hook) should have a visual. Use a tool like [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) for beautiful screenshots or [Screen Studio](https://www.screen.studio/) for polished screen recordings. This is how you stop the scroll.
* **The Support Circle:** Don't launch into the void. Before you post, gather a small group of friends and supporters. As soon as you post your thread, share the link with them and ask them to like, retweet, and comment. This initial velocity is critical for signaling to the algorithm that your content is important.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | Building a continuous narrative; instant feedback loop.                                                               |
| **Ideal Title Format** | The first tweet is the hook. Make it a bold claim ("I just replaced my SaaS with this..."), a surprising stat, or a relatable problem. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A multi-tweet "Launch Thread" with compelling visuals in each tweet.                                                 |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekday mornings (e.g., 8–10 AM EST / 5:30-7:30 PM IST) when tech audiences are most active.                          |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| Pre-written thread with visuals for each tweet; a "support circle" ready to engage immediately; having built an audience beforehand. |
| **CTA Style** | Direct and clear in the final tweet. "Check it out here," "Try it for free," plus a link to your website or Product Hunt page.     |
| **Emotional Tone** | Confident, excited, and engaging. Be ready for rapid-fire conversation.                                             |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-48 hours of primary visibility, but a good thread can be "evergreen" if pinned to your profile.                    |

### **6. Dev.to & Hashnode: The Technical Deep Dive**

These platforms are for developers who want to learn. A launch here is disguised as education. You are not a marketer; you are a fellow developer sharing what you built and how you did it.

* **Your Product is a Case Study:** The golden rule is **show, don't sell**. The article should not be about your product. It should be a technical tutorial where your product is the real-world example.
    * **Good Title:** "How I Built a Real-Time Notification System with Rust and WebSockets"
    * **Bad Title:** "Announcing Notifico, the Best Real-Time Notification System"
* **Code is King:** Your post must include actual code snippets. They should be well-formatted and illustrative of the concepts you're explaining. This proves your technical credibility.
* **Use the Right Tags:** Tags are how developers discover your content. On Dev.to, `#showdev` or `#showcase` is crucial for launches. Combine it with specific tech tags like `#javascript`, `#python`, `#aws`. Hashnode has a similar system. Researching popular relevant tags is a vital pre-launch step.
* **The Canonical Link:** If you post the same article on both Dev.to, Hashnode, and your own blog, you *must* use a canonical link. Both platforms have a setting for this. Point it to your primary blog post to tell Google which one is the original, consolidating your SEO authority and preventing duplicate content penalties.

| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | Technical knowledge sharing; learning from real-world examples.                                                 |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Tutorial or case-study style. "How to..." or "Building a..." or "5 Lessons We Learned Scaling..."               |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A long-form technical article where your product is the case study. Must contain code snippets.               |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekdays, mid-morning (e.g., 10 AM - 12 PM EST).                                                                |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| Well-written, code-heavy article; clear diagrams/screenshots; correct tags identified; canonical URL strategy in place. |
| **CTA Style** | Soft, educational, and placed at the very end. "If you found this useful, you can see the final result in our product here." |
| **Emotional Tone** | Educational, helpful, and technically competent.                                                               |
| **Post Lifespan** | Evergreen. Good technical tutorials get traffic from organic search for months or even years.                 |

### **7. Medium: The Founder's Story**

Medium is for a broader audience that values high-quality writing and compelling narratives. Your launch here is less about the "how" and more about the "why." You are a storyteller.

* **Target a Publication:** Launching on your own Medium profile is fine, but getting into a major publication like *The Startup*, *Better Programming*, or *UX Collective* is a massive amplifier. Each has a "Write for us" page with specific submission rules. You must submit your article as a draft and be prepared for edits.
* **The Narrative Arc:** A great Medium post has a story structure. Start with a personal struggle, introduce the conflict, describe the journey of building the solution (your product), and end with a resolution and a lesson learned. The product launch is the climax of your personal story.
* **Read Time is the Key Metric:** The Medium algorithm promotes articles that people actually finish. Use compelling subheadings, high-quality images, and blockquotes to break up text and keep the reader scrolling.
* **The Headline is Everything:** Your headline must be emotionally resonant and create curiosity. It should feel more like a movie title than a product announcement. Use a headline analyzer tool to test its strength.

| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                             |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | High-quality storytelling; thought leadership.                                                      |
| **Ideal Title Format** | A compelling, story-driven headline that evokes curiosity and emotion.                              |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A long-form narrative article about the "why" behind your project, submitted to a major publication. |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekday mornings.                                                                                   |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| A polished, well-edited draft; a killer header image; researching and submitting to a relevant publication well in advance. |
| **CTA Style** | A subtle, natural link within the closing paragraph. Don't make it feel like an ad.                  |
| **Emotional Tone** | Inspirational, reflective, and story-driven.                                                      |
| **Post Lifespan** | Can be very long if it ranks well in search, is chosen by editors, or is continuously shared.       |

### **8. Lobsters: The Puritan's Pitch**

Think of Lobsters as a more exclusive, more technically rigorous Hacker News. It is an invite-only community of engineers that has an extremely low tolerance for anything that smells like marketing.

* **Get an Invite:** You cannot post without an invitation from an existing member. There is no other way in.
* **No Fluff. Period.** Your title must be descriptive and objective. The post should link directly to a technical artifact: a GitHub repository, a detailed technical blog post, or the tool itself (if it's self-explanatory). Do not link to a marketing landing page.
* **Tags are Mandatory:** You must accurately tag your post. `show` is the tag for showing off a project. Combine it with relevant technology tags (e.g., `rust`, `go`, `linux`). Incorrect tagging is heavily frowned upon.
* **Be Prepared for a Technical Grilling:** The comments will be from experienced engineers who will pick apart your technical decisions. You must be able to defend your choice of architecture, language, and libraries with solid reasoning. This is not a place for "it just works."

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | Deeply technical discussion; engineering rigor.                                                      |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Extremely descriptive and neutral. `[Product Name], a [brief technical description].` No marketing language. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A direct link to a GitHub repo, a deep-dive technical blog post, or the project itself.             |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekdays.                                                                                            |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| Get an invite; have your technical architecture fully documented and be ready to defend your choices in the comments. |
| **CTA Style** | None. The post *is* the CTA. The link is the subject.                                                 |
| **Emotional Tone** | Neutral, technical, and objective. Like presenting a research paper.                                 |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-72 hours on the main page.                                                                        |

### **9. Substack: The Direct Channel**

Substack is not a discovery platform; it's a direct line to an audience you have already earned. The launch here is about converting loyal readers, not finding new ones.

* **The Launch is an "Issue":** Your launch is a special edition of your newsletter. It should not feel like an ad. It should be one of your best, most value-packed issues that also happens to announce your new project.
* **Reward Your Subscribers:** The core of a Substack launch is making your subscribers feel like insiders. Offer them an exclusive, significant discount or benefit that is not available to the general public. This is how you thank them for their loyalty.
* **The Subject Line is Your Title:** The open rate of your email is everything. Craft a subject line that creates immense curiosity and signals that this issue is special, without sounding like spam.
* **The P.S. is Powerful:** Use a P.S. at the end of your newsletter to re-iterate the special offer. It's often one of the most-read parts of an email.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                                        |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | Direct relationship with your audience; owned channel.                                                         |
| **Ideal Title Format** | An email subject line that is highly engaging and teases the big news for your subscribers.                    |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A special, long-form newsletter issue telling the launch story and providing immense value.                    |
| **Ideal Timing** | The day and time your specific audience has the highest open rate (check your Substack analytics).               |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| An engaged email list built over time by providing consistent value; a compelling, exclusive offer for subscribers. |
| **CTA Style** | Direct and clear, emphasizing exclusivity. "As a subscriber, you get X. Click here to claim it."                |
| **Emotional Tone** | Intimate and appreciative. You are speaking directly to your most loyal supporters.                            |
| **Post Lifespan** | The email has a 24-48 hour open window, but the post lives permanently on your Substack site for new subscribers to discover. |

***

### **10. Peerlist: The Professional Showcase**

Peerlist is a professional network for people in tech, centered around a portfolio of verifiable work. A launch here is about documenting a project's completion and adding it to your professional legacy.

* **The Project Profile is Everything:** Before you can launch, you must create a project profile. The key is to get this profile to **100% completion**. This includes a detailed description, a link, high-quality visuals (screenshots, mockups), and the tech stack you used.
* **Launchpad is on Monday:** Peerlist has a dedicated "Launchpad" section for new projects. You can only launch on a Monday. This creates a weekly focal point for discovery.
* **It's About Your Resume:** Think of a Peerlist launch as adding a new, major achievement to your public resume. The community is interested in the work itself and the skills you demonstrated. It's calmer and less "competitive" than Product Hunt.
* **Engage with Other Profiles:** Peerlist is a network. The best way to get eyes on your launch is to be an active user. Follow other interesting people, comment on their projects, and participate in discussions.

| **Post Lifespan** | 24 hours of primary focus on the Launchpad, but becomes a permanent, verifiable fixture in your online work portfolio. |

### **11. Stack Overflow: The Anti-Launch Platform**

This is the most critical one to understand: **You cannot launch a product on Stack Overflow.** It is a strict Q&A site, not a forum or a promotional platform. Any attempt at direct promotion will be aggressively flagged and removed, and your account may be banned.

* **The ONLY Legitimate Path:** The only way to leverage Stack Overflow is indirectly and over a long period.
    1.  **Become an Expert:** Pick the tag(s) related to the problem your product solves (e.g., `#google-sheets-api`, `#stripe-api`).
    2.  **Answer Questions:** Spend months or years providing high-quality, genuinely helpful answers to questions in those tags.
    3.  **Build Reputation:** As your reputation score grows, you become a trusted community member.
* **The Indirect Benefit:** People will see your high-quality answers and click on your profile out of curiosity. Your profile can have a link to your website or project. This is the only acceptable form of "promotion." Traffic from here is highly qualified, but it is a marathon, not a sprint.
* **Disclosure is Mandatory:** In the rare case that a question is asked where your tool is a direct, perfect answer, you *may* post a link, but you **must** explicitly disclose your affiliation (e.g., "Full disclosure: I'm the founder of this tool..."). Failure to do so is a serious breach of community trust.
