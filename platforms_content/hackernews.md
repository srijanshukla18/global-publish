Hacker News (HN): The Understated Pitch
Hacker News, run by Y Combinator, is the quintessential forum for technologists. The community values intellectual curiosity, technical elegance, and substance over style. A launch on HN is less of a "launch" and more of a "submission for peer review." Your product and your demeanor will be judged critically.

"Show HN" is Your Entry Ticket: This is the most important rule. If you are showing something you made, you must prepend your title with Show HN:. This tags your post correctly and signals to the community that it's a personal project or product, setting the right expectations.

The Title is Plain and Factual: The HN community has a visceral hatred for marketing-speak. Your title must be brutally honest and descriptive.

Good: Show HN: Myapp - A tool for converting Figma designs to Tailwind CSS

Bad: Show HN: Myapp - The revolutionary, game-changing AI tool that will 10x your design workflow

The Link Must Deliver Instant Value: Do not link to a landing page that is just a form to collect emails. The link must go to the actual product, a demo, a GitHub repo, or a detailed technical blog post. The user must be able to interact with or learn something substantial in one click. Hitting a "sign up now" wall is a common reason for downvotes.

The Creator's First Comment: While not a strict rule, it is strong etiquette for the creator to post the first comment. This comment should be concise and provide additional context that doesn't fit in the title. Briefly explain the problem you're solving, the technology stack you used (if interesting), and perhaps what kind of feedback you're looking for.

Embrace Critical Feedback: The comments will be direct, and not always positive. Users will find bugs, question your technical decisions, and point out competitors. Do not be defensive. Thank users for their feedback (even the harsh kind), be honest about trade-offs you made, and answer questions transparently. A founder who engages humbly and honestly wins immense respect.
