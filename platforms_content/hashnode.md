### **6. Dev.to & Hashnode: The Technical Deep Dive**

These platforms are for developers who want to learn. A launch here is disguised as education. You are not a marketer; you are a fellow developer sharing what you built and how you did it.

* **Your Product is a Case Study:** The golden rule is **show, don't sell**. The article should not be about your product. It should be a technical tutorial where your product is the real-world example.
    * **Good Title:** "How I Built a Real-Time Notification System with Rust and WebSockets"
    * **Bad Title:** "Announcing Notifico, the Best Real-Time Notification System"
* **Code is King:** Your post must include actual code snippets. They should be well-formatted and illustrative of the concepts you're explaining. This proves your technical credibility.
* **Use the Right Tags:** Tags are how developers discover your content. On Dev.to, `#showdev` or `#showcase` is crucial for launches. Combine it with specific tech tags like `#javascript`, `#python`, `#aws`. Hashnode has a similar system. Researching popular relevant tags is a vital pre-launch step.
* **The Canonical Link:** If you post the same article on both Dev.to, Hashnode, and your own blog, you *must* use a canonical link. Both platforms have a setting for this. Point it to your primary blog post to tell Google which one is the original, consolidating your SEO authority and preventing duplicate content penalties.
