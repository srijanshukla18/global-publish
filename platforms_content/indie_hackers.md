### **4. Indie Hackers: The Transparency Report**

Indie Hackers is for founders, by founders. They don't care about polished marketing; they care about raw numbers, authenticity, and the messy reality of building a business.

* **Revenue is the Ultimate Social Proof:** The single most respected feature on IH is the public revenue tracker on your product page. Be transparent. Even if it's $50 MRR, it's infinitely more respected than $0.
* **Launch as a "Milestone," Not a "Product":** The community is more receptive to journey updates than to launch announcements. Frame your post as a milestone, e.g., "We just hit 100 users and are officially launching out of beta!"
* **The "Ask IH" Post:** A great way to soft-launch is to ask for feedback on a specific part of your business, e.g., "Ask IH: How would you price this? [link to product]". It gets eyes on your product in a way that is framed as a request for help, which the community loves to provide.
* **Engage with the Big Names:** The founder, Courtland Allen, and other prominent IH members are very active. A comment or upvote from them on your launch post can be a huge signal boost.
