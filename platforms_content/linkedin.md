### **3. LinkedIn: The Professional's "Build in Public" Stage

LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors personal stories from founders over corporate brand pages. The key is to maximize "dwell time."

* **The "Dwell Time" Algorithm:** LinkedIn wants to keep users on your post. A simple link pointing away from LinkedIn is the worst thing you can do.
* **The Carousel (PDF) Post:** This is the ultimate format. Create a 5-10 slide PDF presentation telling a story. People have to click through, which massively boosts dwell time.
* **"Link in the First Comment":** This is a critical, platform-specific tactic. In your post, write "Link in the comments!". Then, post the link as the very first comment. This prevents the algorithm from penalizing your post for an external link.
* **The "Broetry" Format:** Write your posts in short, one-sentence paragraphs. This is optimized for mobile reading and slows people down, increasing dwell time.
* **The First 90 Minutes Matter Most:** The algorithm decides a post's fate in the first hour and a half. Rally your team and supporters to comment and react as soon as you post. Reply to every single comment immediately.
* **Tell a Personal Story:** Frame the launch around your personal journey. "I almost gave up 3 times while building this..." performs infinitely better than "Our company is excited to announce..."
