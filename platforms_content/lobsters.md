### **8. Lobsters: The Puritan's Pitch**

Think of Lobsters as a more exclusive, more technically rigorous Hacker News. It is an invite-only community of engineers that has an extremely low tolerance for anything that smells like marketing.

* **Get an Invite:** You cannot post without an invitation from an existing member. There is no other way in.
* **No Fluff. Period.** Your title must be descriptive and objective. The post should link directly to a technical artifact: a GitHub repository, a detailed technical blog post, or the tool itself (if it's self-explanatory). Do not link to a marketing landing page.
* **Tags are Mandatory:** You must accurately tag your post. `show` is the tag for showing off a project. Combine it with relevant technology tags (e.g., `rust`, `go`, `linux`). Incorrect tagging is heavily frowned upon.
* **Be Prepared for a Technical Grilling:** The comments will be from experienced engineers who will pick apart your technical decisions. You must be able to defend your choice of architecture, language, and libraries with solid reasoning. This is not a place for "it just works."

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title      | Details                                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Value** | Deeply technical discussion; engineering rigor.                                                      |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Extremely descriptive and neutral. `[Product Name], a [brief technical description].` No marketing language. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A direct link to a GitHub repo, a deep-dive technical blog post, or the project itself.             |
| **Ideal Timing** | Weekdays.                                                                                            |
| **Critical Launch Prep**| Get an invite; have your technical architecture fully documented and be ready to defend your choices in the comments. |
| **CTA Style** | None. The post *is* the CTA. The link is the subject.                                                 |
| **Emotional Tone** | Neutral, technical, and objective. Like presenting a research paper.                                 |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-72 hours on the main page.                                                                        |
