### **7. Medium: The Founder's Story**

Medium is for a broader audience that values high-quality writing and compelling narratives. Your launch here is less about the "how" and more about the "why." You are a storyteller.

* **Target a Publication:** Launching on your own Medium profile is fine, but getting into a major publication like *The Startup*, *Better Programming*, or *UX Collective* is a massive amplifier. Each has a "Write for us" page with specific submission rules. You must submit your article as a draft and be prepared for edits.
* **The Narrative Arc:** A great Medium post has a story structure. Start with a personal struggle, introduce the conflict, describe the journey of building the solution (your product), and end with a resolution and a lesson learned. The product launch is the climax of your personal story.
* **Read Time is the Key Metric:** The Medium algorithm promotes articles that people actually finish. Use compelling subheadings, high-quality images, and blockquotes to break up text and keep the reader scrolling.
* **The Headline is Everything:** Your headline must be emotionally resonant and create curiosity. It should feel more like a movie title than a product announcement. Use a headline analyzer tool to test its strength.
