### **10. Peerlist: The Professional Showcase**

Peerlist is a professional network for people in tech, centered around a portfolio of verifiable work. A launch here is about documenting a project's completion and adding it to your professional legacy.

* **The Project Profile is Everything:** Before you can launch, you must create a project profile. The key is to get this profile to **100% completion**. This includes a detailed description, a link, high-quality visuals (screenshots, mockups), and the tech stack you used.
* **Launchpad is on Monday:** Peerlist has a dedicated "Launchpad" section for new projects. You can only launch on a Monday. This creates a weekly focal point for discovery.
* **It's About Your Resume:** Think of a Peerlist launch as adding a new, major achievement to your public resume. The community is interested in the work itself and the skills you demonstrated. It's calmer and less "competitive" than Product Hunt.
* **Engage with Other Profiles:** Peerlist is a network. The best way to get eyes on your launch is to be an active user. Follow other interesting people, comment on their projects, and participate in discussions.
