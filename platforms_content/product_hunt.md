### **1. Product Hunt: The 24-Hour Gauntlet**

Product Hunt is not a discovery platform; it's a 24-hour launch competition. Your goal isn't just to be on it, but to finish in the **Top 5** for the day to get the coveted newsletter feature and lasting visibility.

* **The Hunter is Overrated (Sort of):** In the past, a top "Hunter" (someone who posts the product) was critical. Now, it's less important. The algorithm prioritizes organic engagement. It's better to hunt the product yourself or have a teammate do it. This gives you full control over the assets and timing.
* **The 12:01 AM PST Rule:** This is non-negotiable. Launches run on a 24-hour cycle starting at midnight Pacific Time. Launching at 12:01 AM gives you the maximum possible time to gather upvotes and climb the leaderboard.
* **The Maker's First Comment:** This is a critical, expected tradition. As soon as your product is live, the first comment *must* be from you (the "Maker"). It should be your origin story, include an exclusive deal for the PH community (e.g., "25% off with code PH25"), and end with a question to encourage engagement.
* **The Animated GIF Thumbnail:** A static logo is a death sentence. Your thumbnail *must* be an animated GIF that quickly demonstrates what your product does. It's the single most important visual asset for stopping the scroll.
* **Don't Ask for Upvotes, Ask for "Feedback":** Directly asking for upvotes is a cardinal sin. The correct way to phrase your outreach is: *"We're live on Product Hunt today! Would love to get your feedback and support on our launch."*
* **Engage with Every Single Comment:** Your job on launch day is to be the most responsive person on the internet. Reply to every comment within minutes if possible. The algorithm rewards active, engaged discussions.
