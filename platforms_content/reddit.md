### **2. Reddit: The Art of Infiltration**

Reddit despises self-promotion. You cannot just show up and drop a link. A successful launch is the final step of a longer process of becoming a genuine community member.

* **Subreddit Reconnaissance:** Every subreddit is a different country with its own laws and culture. Your strategy for `r/javascript` will fail in `r/sideproject`. Spend at least two weeks before your launch being active in your target subreddit.
* **The "Value-First" Post:** Never lead with your product. Lead with value. Write a tutorial or share a story about a problem you solved. Mention your tool at the very end as a "P.S." or when someone asks in the comments.
* **The Karma Threshold:** Many subreddits have minimum karma and account age requirements to post. A brand new account will be automatically blocked. You *must* use an established account with a positive history.
* **The "Soft Ask" in Comments:** Often, the best strategy is to not even link your product in the main post. Write a post about a problem. When someone comments, "Is there a tool that does X?", that is your golden opportunity to reply with your link. This is seen as helpful, not spammy.

🎯 **Summary of Platform-Specific Rules**
| Rule/Value Title | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Value** | Providing value to a specific community; authenticity over polish. |
| **Ideal Title Format** | Varies by subreddit. "How I solved [problem]" or "I built a tool to..." works well. Avoid brand names. |
| **Suggested Post Type** | A "Value-First" post (tutorial, story) with a soft mention, OR a "Show and Tell" post in a relevant sub like `r/sideproject`. |
| **Ideal Timing** | Subreddit-specific. Typically weekday mornings in the dominant timezone of the sub (e.g., US morning for `r/programming`). |
| **Critical Launch Prep** | High-karma, established account; 2+ weeks of genuine participation in the target sub; read the sidebar rules meticulously. |
| **CTA Style** | Very soft. "Link in comments if anyone's interested," or replying to a direct question. |
| **Emotional Tone** | Helpful community member, not a marketer. Humble and open to criticism. |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-48 hours on the subreddit's "hot" page. |
