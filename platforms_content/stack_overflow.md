### **11. Stack Overflow: The Anti-Launch Platform**

This is the most critical one to understand: **You cannot launch a product on Stack Overflow.** It is a strict Q&A site, not a forum or a promotional platform. Any attempt at direct promotion will be aggressively flagged and removed, and your account may be banned.

* **The ONLY Legitimate Path:** The only way to leverage Stack Overflow is indirectly and over a long period.
    1.  **Become an Expert:** Pick the tag(s) related to the problem your product solves (e.g., `#google-sheets-api`, `#stripe-api`).
    2.  **Answer Questions:** Spend months or years providing high-quality, genuinely helpful answers to questions in those tags.
    3.  **Build Reputation:** As your reputation score grows, you become a trusted community member.
* **The Indirect Benefit:** People will see your high-quality answers and click on your profile out of curiosity. Your profile can have a link to your website or project. This is the only acceptable form of "promotion." Traffic from here is highly qualified, but it is a marathon, not a sprint.
* **Disclosure is Mandatory:** In the rare case that a question is asked where your tool is a direct, perfect answer, you *may* post a link, but you **must** explicitly disclose your affiliation (e.g., "Full disclosure: I'm the founder of this tool..."). Failure to do so is a serious breach of community trust.
