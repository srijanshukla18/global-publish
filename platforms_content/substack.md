### **9. Substack: The Direct Channel**

Substack is not a discovery platform; it's a direct line to an audience you have already earned. The launch here is about converting loyal readers, not finding new ones.

* **The Launch is an "Issue":** Your launch is a special edition of your newsletter. It should not feel like an ad. It should be one of your best, most value-packed issues that also happens to announce your new project.
* **Reward Your Subscribers:** The core of a Substack launch is making your subscribers feel like insiders. Offer them an exclusive, significant discount or benefit that is not available to the general public. This is how you thank them for their loyalty.
* **The Subject Line is Your Title:** The open rate of your email is everything. Craft a subject line that creates immense curiosity and signals that this issue is special, without sounding like spam.
* **The P.S. is Powerful:** Use a P.S. at the end of your newsletter to re-iterate the special offer. It's often one of the most-read parts of an email.
