### **5. Twitter/X: The Narrative Thread**

On Twitter/X, a launch isn't a single moment; it's the climax of a public narrative. Success comes from building an audience that is already invested in your journey and wants to see you win.

* **The Launch Thread is Mandatory:** A single tweet will get lost. You must use a multi-tweet thread to tell a story. The classic, effective structure is:
    1.  **The Hook:** The first tweet. Make it a bold claim, a relatable problem, or a surprising stat. This is 80% of the battle.
    2.  **The Problem:** Agitate the pain point your product solves.
    3.  **The Solution:** Introduce your product as the solution.
    4.  **Key Features:** Use 2-3 tweets to show off the best features, each with a high-quality screenshot or, even better, a short screen recording (GIF).
    5.  **Social Proof:** A tweet with a testimonial or a compliment you've received.
    6.  **The Ask/CTA:** The final tweet with the clear call to action and the link.
* **"Build in Public" is Your Pre-Launch:** The real work happens in the months before you launch. Tweet about your progress, share mockups and ask for feedback, talk about the challenges. This builds an audience that feels like they are part of the story.
* **Visuals are Non-Negotiable:** Every tweet in your launch thread (except maybe the first hook) should have a visual. Use a tool like [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) for beautiful screenshots or [Screen Studio](https://www.screen.studio/) for polished screen recordings. This is how you stop the scroll.
* **The Support Circle:** Don't launch into the void. Before you post, gather a small group of friends and supporters. As soon as you post your thread, share the link with them and ask them to like, retweet, and comment. This initial velocity is critical for signaling to the algorithm that your content is important.

| **Emotional Tone** | Confident, excited, and engaging. Be ready for rapid-fire conversation.                                             |
| **Post Lifespan** | 24-48 hours of primary visibility, but a good thread can be "evergreen" if pinned to your profile.                    |
